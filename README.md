Nessus Vulnerability Scanning Automation

Nessus Vulnerability Scanning Automation (PyNVSA) is a python script that allows you to automate the process of vulnerability management in your infrastructure.

PyNVSA creates targets list using the data that was received from different sources such as SIEM, CMDB, etc. Then it launches vulnerability scans and gets its reports through Nessus API. Finally reports can be uploaded to SIEM for futher analysis and correlation.
